# WELCOME!

Hello, I'm Gopi an senior ITI major at Rutgers Universty focusing in the areas of Web Design, Game Design, and Cyber Security. Feel free to checkout some of my projects here!
  
I am a person who loves to explore! From places in the world to new concepts, I always have a nature of curiousity that only stops once I gain understanding of it. Otherwise, I'm always available to have a chat about complex ideas in psychology or technology.

Currently, I'm seeking oppurunities in the Web Design or Game Design fields, but I'm willing to explore any opportunities I can!

#### ðŸŒ± I am currently learning:
