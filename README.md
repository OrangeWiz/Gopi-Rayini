# WELCOME!

Hello, I'm Gopi, a recent graduated ITI student from Rutgers Universty! During my time at Rutgers, I was mainly focusing my study in the areas of Web Development and Game Development. Feel free to checkout some of my projects here!

# About Me

I am a person who loves to explore! From places in the world to new concepts, I always have a nature of curiousity that only stops once I gain understanding of it. Otherwise, I'm always available to have a chat about complex ideas in psychology or technology.

Currently, I'm seeking oppurunities in the Web Dev field, but I'm willing to explore any opportunities I can!
